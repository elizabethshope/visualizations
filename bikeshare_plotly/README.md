## Capital Bikeshare Trips Per Hour
This is a Plotly time series visualization that shows hourly trip counts over the course of three different weeks. This directory contains the code for creating the visualization. You can see the visualization along with some analysis on my website at http://elizabeth-shope.com/portfolio/capital_bikeshare_plotly.html.
