# Data Visualization
## Energy Generation in the United States by Source and Year (1990-2015)
This is a stacked area chart data visualization that I built with Python 3 and Plotly. This directory contains the cleaned data and code for the visualization. You can view the visualization on my website at http://elizabeth-shope.com/portfolio/us_energy_generation_plotly.html.
