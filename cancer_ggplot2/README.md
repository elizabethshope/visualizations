## Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the United States: An Exploration
This is a set of ggplot2 visualizations exploring cancer incidence and mortality in the United States. This directory contains the cleaned data and code for the visualization. You can view the individual plots here, or view them together with some analysis on my website at http://elizabeth-shope.com/portfolio/cancer_ggplot2.html.
