## Bikeshare Behavior in Resident vs. Tourist Riders
This is a set of ggplot2 visualizations exploring Capital Bikeshare usage behavior in resident vs. tourist riders. This directory contains code for creating the visualizations, as well as the visualizations the code creates. You can view the individual plots here, or view them together with some analysis on my website at http://elizabeth-shope.com/portfolio/bikeshare_ggplot2.html.
